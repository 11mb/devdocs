<h1>Magento 2 Developer Documentation&mdash;The Transition</h1>

For the first time, Magento developer documentation is on this public github.
From humble beginnings ... currently, we have a small subset of Services framework
documentation available but by the start of the Magento Imagine eCommerce Conference on
May 12, 2014, we'll expand it.

_Update_: We're moving our content from another github. Please be patient.

Where's the rest of it? Still on the <a href="https://wiki.magento.com/display/MAGE2DOC/Magento+2+Product+Documentation" target="_blank">Magento public wiki</a>. 

Please look around, send us comments, [let us know](mailto:DL-Magento-Doc-Feedback@ebay.com) how you think we're doing.
We're here to serve _you_ so let us hear from you.

<p>&mdash;Magento documentation team</p>
